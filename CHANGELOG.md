# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Tool batches close on the SDK's own signals instead of a fixed 1.5 s settle: `partial-tool-call` / `tool-call-started` announce a custom tool call before its execute, `step-completed` ends the model call. A batch is published as soon as no announced call is outstanding and the SDK has been idle for `TOOL_BATCH_IDLE_MS` (default now 200), or immediately on `step-completed`; `TOOL_BATCH_SETTLE_MS` stays the cap and late calls are still carried. `batch_close` adds `step_completed`.
- The final boundary is published on the SDK `turn-ended` delta with that turn's usage instead of after `run.stream()` EOF and `run.wait()`. Round logs add `turn_ended_ms`, `run_settled_ms`, `publish_lag_ms`, and `announce_lead_ms`; `npm run live:timing` records `text_tail_ms`. Each SSE event is written as one chunk. Live A/B vs `main` (11/11): tool `batch_close_wait_ms` 1500–1502 → 200–234; text `text_tail_ms` 76–122 → 4–21. Receipt: `docs/evidence/2026-09-12-streaming-responsiveness-diff.md`.
- `/v1/responses` accepts Codex `agent_message` input items as user turns; `encrypted_content` parts degrade to a placeholder instead of returning 400 `unsupported input item type: agent_message`.
- `HOSTED_SEARCH_MODE=auto` accepts a hosted `web_search` tool that carries Codex filter fields (`user_location`, `search_context_size`, `external_web_access`) and ignores them instead of returning 400 `web_search filters are not supported`. Required/named choice, Chat `web_search_options`, and `x_search` stay 4xx.

## 0.4.0

- Fix GitHub Issue #25: Anthropic SSE in-stream errors now close open blocks, emit `message_delta` + `message_stop`, then one public `error`, without a second handler write.
- Add explicit `sdk` / `sand` runtime profiles. Default remains `sdk`. Sand requires Grok Bot grant, a hash-guarded `@cursor/sdk` 1.0.30 loader, and isolated store/workspace. Changing profile on an existing session is `409`.
- Add optional SQLite WAL runtime ledger (`RUNTIME_LEDGER_V2`, default off): one logical claim, disconnect observer, and a single provider receipt with numeric token usage only.
- Console and `/v1/account` keep Cursor period quota and Grok Bot weekly quota as separate progress. Runtime SDK|Sand applies to new sessions only.
- Add `POST /v1/responses/compact` and `compaction_trigger` with gateway-local HMAC anchors prefixed `csgw1.`. Tamper/cross-binding fails closed. Compact does not call Cursor Send.
- Hosted `web_search` is opt-in via `HOSTED_SEARCH_MODE=auto` for a bare live tool. Filters, required/named choice, Chat `web_search_options`, and `x_search` stay 4xx.
- `/health` reports default/sdk/sand readiness, SDK version, and patch contract version without filesystem paths.
- new-api channel templates document profile, compact, and receipt billing. Gateway version now follows `package.json`.

## Unreleased

- Console shows each API key's next Cursor period reset and Grok Bot weekly reset as a local date and time on Quota, Accounts, and account detail.
- `/v1/responses` accepts Codex CLI 0.153+ top-level `type: "namespace"` tools the same way as `additional_tools` children. Empty grouping namespaces are ignored; hosted `web_search` still requires `HOSTED_SEARCH_MODE=auto`.
- Document OpenCodex as an `openai-responses` sidecar in front of this gateway.
- Tool items stream when the SDK requests the tool; stream, non-stream body, replay, and `response.completed.output` share one ordered journal, including events that fire before `send()` resolves. Only the stop reason waits for the batch to close.
- Round logs carry numeric timings per segment (`agent_ready_ms`, `first_sdk_event_ms`, `first_client_write_ms`, `tool_count`, `tool_spread_ms`, `batch_close_wait_ms`, `duration_ms`, `tool_result_gap_ms`). `SSE_HEARTBEAT_MS` (default 15000) keeps a started SSE response alive. `npm run live:timing` measures a tool round.
- `@cursor/sdk` 1.0.31 with a rehashed `sand` patch contract. Public delta schema and core adapter unchanged from 1.0.30.
- `HOST_SYSTEM_PROMPT_MODE=replace` (opt-in; default stays `inline`) passes the client system prompt as the SDK `systemPrompt`, bound to the session and its lineage by mode and digest: a changed prompt re-applies through `Agent.resume`, a mid-turn restart resume follows the stored mode even if `HOST_SYSTEM_PROMPT_MODE` changed, and a resume without the stored prompt is `409`. Gated accounts retry inline and are remembered.
- SDK output that arrives after a batch closed is carried into the next turn in order (a late tool call as its own batch, late text or thinking at the head) instead of failing the session or being dropped. `TOOL_BATCH_IDLE_MS` (default off) can close earlier on SDK delta silence; `batch_close` is `settle_timer`, `idle`, or `carried`.
- Ordinary turns now follow BeefAPI's Cursor Agent contract: a typed turn IR, exact-lineage Agent reuse, and `send(current turn)` instead of flattening the whole transcript on every request. Tool continuation, `x-cursor-session-id` follow-up, and cold rebuild remain. Disable with `ORDINARY_TURN_COORDINATOR=0`.

- `/v1/messages` accepts sub2api compatibility roles without flattening the transcript: `system`/`developer` remain in order, historical `tool`/`function` output stays visible to the Harness, and a trailing tool result requires a real call id before entering continuation lookup.
- `/v1/responses` accepts `text.format.type=json_schema` as an explicit Harness output contract instead of silently dropping it. Client-executed function, custom/freeform, and namespace declarations inside `input[].type=additional_tools` join the real MCP tool catalog; a same-name top-level declaration is authoritative, matching Codex Responses Lite. Custom calls use native `custom_tool_call` events and namespace identities are restored on output. Conflicts within one additional catalog and provider-hosted tool shapes still fail closed.
- `/v1/account` now reads current-period spending, remaining included usage, model-family percentages, plan metadata, and limits through Cursor Dashboard using the same User API Key, without Cookie or Team Admin credentials. Missing usage remains a partial response rather than a fabricated zero quota.
- Added authenticated `/v1/messages/count_tokens` as an explicitly marked local estimate for Claude Code context management; it never starts an SDK run or participates in billing.

- Operator Console now uses BF Labs UI tokens, Button/Tabs/Notice/Reveal motion (entry, hover lift, orange progress pulse) with reduced-motion support. Console density is preserved; marketing-card invert is not used.
- Console motion follow-through: overview CountUp, copy toast plus button flash, and a sliding rail indicator that follows the current page.
- Failed requests now log the concrete `invalid_request` reason (redacted) next to `error_type`.
- Operator Console and README pin client-to-endpoint recipes: Claude Code → Messages, Grok Build → Responses, OpenAI SDK → Chat. Console documents that outer-agent file tools stay local.
- Responses `include` is accepted and not expanded so Grok Build's Responses backend can connect. `previous_response_id`, `store=true`, conversation, and hosted tools still fail closed.
- Responses usage always includes `input_tokens_details` and `output_tokens_details` so strict clients (Grok Build) can deserialize the object.
- Responses now accepts Grok's named-function/required tool choice, preserves full-history tool continuation, reports SDK reasoning usage, and keeps client-side tool paths anchored to the caller workspace instead of the internal SDK cwd.
- Pending tool turns can recover after a gateway crash through persisted Agent lineage + `Agent.resume` + `local.force=true`; exact identity/catalog/result-batch checks and duplicate-same singleflight remain fail closed on conflict.
- `/v1/chat/completions` protocol adapter over the existing Anthropic `ParsedMessages` run engine. Contract-tested text, OpenAI SSE, function tools, continuation, replay, deferred and cache-aware usage, images, and OpenAI error shapes.
- `/v1/responses` protocol adapter over the same run engine. Contract-tested non-stream text, Responses SSE lifecycle, reasoning, base64 `input_image`, function tools, same-turn parallel calls, `function_call_output` continuation by `call_id`, duplicate-same replay, deferred/final cache-aware usage, `reasoning_effort` / `cursor_model_params`, and Responses-shaped errors. `previous_response_id`, `store=true`, background, conversation, include expansions, and hosted built-in tools fail closed. Operator Console includes a Responses playground tab.
- Optional BF Labs Operator Console at `/console/`, bundled as static Vite assets and served by the existing Node process. It includes health, model/account reads, Messages/Chat/Responses playground, connection snippets, English/Chinese, and light/dark modes. Keys remain in page memory only.

## 0.1.0

- Standard HTTP(S) `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` support for both official SDK data planes. Proxied Agent runs switch to HTTP/1.1 through `proxy-agent`; catalog/account fetches use Undici's environment dispatcher; direct runs retain HTTP/2. SOCKS/PAC fails closed. Health exposes only the boolean plus Agent/fetch transport modes.
- Claude tool-batch debounce raised from 100ms to 1500ms after live callback timing showed same-turn callbacks up to 1189ms apart. Sonnet 4.6 and Fable 5 then passed the full 18-case proxied matrix, including parallel tools, cache reads/writes, completed resume, and Fable Claude Code shape.
- Review fixes: empty-turn only after `run.wait()`, strict SSE block order, per-boundary delta replay, native `isError` tool results, bounded expired tool IDs with periodic sweep, follow-up toolIndex reset.
- Streaming uses official `SendOptions.onDelta` (`text-delta` / `thinking-delta`); `run.stream()` stays single-consumer for tool/status/terminal.
- Completed Agent lineage on credential-partitioned official `JsonlLocalAgentStore` directories (`STATE_DIR/sdk-store/<fingerprint>`) plus owner-only lineage metadata. Health reports `agent_resume=true`, `pending_tool_restart_resume=false`, `store_backend=jsonl`. Duplicate-same after restart is `session_lost` (digest only).
- Active-run limits apply to create, completed follow-up, and persisted resume. Drain still accepts awaiting `tool_result`.

- Repository bootstrap and MIT license.
- `/health`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/account`, `/v1/messages`.
- Anthropic non-stream and SSE text.
- In-process session broker for single, parallel, and multi-round client tools.
- Honest models/account degradation and final-only usage confirmation.
