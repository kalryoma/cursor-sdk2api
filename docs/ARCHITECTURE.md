# Architecture

## Ownership

One live SDK Run has one owner process and one event-pump consumer.

```
HTTP /v1/messages | /v1/chat/completions | /v1/responses
  -> protocol parse (Chat/Responses convert to canonical ParsedMessages)
  -> CursorAgentTurn (protocol-neutral ordinary-turn IR)
  -> RunCoordinator
       -> SdkRunDriver (the only create/resume/send/pump wiring)
       -> tool_result: existing ATTACH / lineage resume / transcript recovery
       -> exact successor: Agent.resume/send(current turn text+images only)
       -> unknown/fork/compact: cold rebuild with full transcript fallback
       -> SessionRegistry (fingerprint, model, tool_use_id, TTL)
       -> ToolBridge (request tools -> local.customTools)
       -> EventPump (single run.stream() consumer for tool/status/terminal)
       -> protocol writer seam (Anthropic SSE, OpenAI Chat data chunks, or Responses events)
       -> SdkRuntime (injected; production adapter wraps @cursor/sdk)
```

`/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/responses` do not own a second session or continuation engine. They reuse the same RunCoordinator, pending-tool Map, replay, and identity binding. Only the request parser and HTTP writer differ.

Responses continuation is not `previous_response_id` reconstruction. The parser accepts a full Responses transcript and treats only the latest trailing `function_call_output` batch as the continuation. Completed follow-up still uses `x-cursor-session-id` exactly as Messages/Chat. `previous_response_id`, `store=true`, background, conversation, and hosted built-in tools fail closed. The known optional `reasoning.encrypted_content` include is accepted but omitted; unknown expansions fail closed.

Text/thinking streaming uses official `SendOptions.onDelta` (`text-delta` / `thinking-delta`); `token-delta` is a liveness count only. Deltas and tool callbacks that fire before the pump exists share one ordered queue on the Session and are drained in arrival order. When onDelta is active, `run.stream()` assistant/thinking snapshots are not forwarded again.

One ordered journal per HTTP response segment is the source for SSE, the non-stream body, in-process replay, and `response.completed.output`. Consecutive text or thinking deltas fold into one block; tool calls stay where the SDK requested them. `finish()` writes only the unstreamed tail. The Responses writer and encoder share one item-id rule.

`customTool.execute` is the authority for client-visible tools. Writers emit the `tool_use` / `tool_calls` / `function_call` item when `execute` fires; only the stop reason waits for the batch to close. SDK `tool_call` stream events are diagnostic.

A tool batch closes `TOOL_BATCH_SETTLE_MS` after the latest `execute`, or earlier on SDK delta silence when `TOOL_BATCH_IDLE_MS` is set (settle stays the cap). No SDK delta marks the end of a model generation before local tools run ([probe](evidence/2026-09-04-tool-batch-close-live-probe.md)). SDK output that arrives after the batch was published is carried, in order, into the next segment: a tool call opens it as its own batch, text or thinking heads its journal. Continuation and lineage use only the published batch. Logs: `batch_close` (`settle_timer` / `idle` / `carried`), `batch_close_wait_ms`, `tool_spread_ms`, `tool_result_gap_ms`; segment timings restart on every continuation.

`SSE_HEARTBEAT_MS` sends Anthropic `ping` events or SSE comment lines after the first protocol event. It never fires before headers, so pre-semantic failover is unaffected.

`HOST_SYSTEM_PROMPT_MODE=inline` (default) sends the client system prompt inside the first user turn. `replace` passes it as the SDK `systemPrompt` on create and resume, restating harness tool context when tools exist and dropping the inline `System:` block; the SDK does not persist it, so the session and its lineage record bind the prompt's mode and digest. A follow-up on a live handle with a different prompt resumes the same agent with the new prompt. A restart resume mid-turn needs the same prompt and re-applies it the way the stored session did, whatever the current mode; a new turn needs some prompt. Otherwise `409 cursor_session_conflict` (a complete transcript still cold-recovers). An account without access fails the first `send` naming `--system-prompt`; the gateway retries that request inline and remembers the credential.

`SdkRunDriver` maps one custom-tool table before Agent create/resume and carries that same table through `send()` and EventPump attachment. Deltas and tool callbacks that fire synchronously during Agent resume or send are queued on the Session and drained, in order, once the pump is attached; the coordinator never remaps tools or calls `Agent.resume` directly.

## Network transport

Direct local SDK runs retain the official HTTP/2 transport. Node does not apply
standard proxy environment variables to that transport automatically. When an
HTTP(S) proxy is configured, startup switches Agent traffic to HTTP/1.1 and
installs `proxy-agent` as the Node HTTP/HTTPS global agent. SDK fetch traffic
(`models.list` and account lookup) separately uses Undici's
`EnvHttpProxyAgent`; both paths honor `NO_PROXY`. SOCKS/PAC is rejected instead
of allowing one SDK path to bypass the proxy. The gateway never stores or
returns proxy URLs; health reports only the active Agent and fetch modes.

## State machine

`Creating -> Running -> AwaitingToolResults -> Resuming -> Running -> ... -> Completed`

Any active state can go to `Failed` or `Cancelled`, then `Closed`.

Pending calls live in a `Map<toolUseId, PendingCall>`. There is no single-pending shortcut.

## Restart

SDK Agent history lives in credential-partitioned `$STATE_DIR/sdk-store/<fingerprint>` directories via the official `JsonlLocalAgentStore`. Each credential also receives a private empty-workspace partition. Gateway lineage (`$STATE_DIR/lineage`) keeps only resume metadata: session id, SDK agent id, credential fingerprint, model and explicit model parameters, canonical session-policy and executable-tool-catalog digests, state, pending tool ids, optional result digest, and timestamps. Lineage schema v2 fails closed and quarantines older/incomplete records instead of silently resuming them.

Ordinary multi-turn requests without `x-cursor-session-id` use a credential-free journal of digests (`STATE_DIR/ordinary-turns.json`). Exact linear successors reuse the same Agent and `send()` only the latest user text/images. Forks, compact/missing anchors, model/effort/tool-catalog mismatches, and credential rotation cold-rebuild. Identical request digests replay in-process; after a process restart they fail closed because assistant bodies are not persisted.

Completed follow-up with `x-cursor-session-id` looks up lineage, checks credential/model/session policy, then `Agent.resume` + `send` on that same store. `ORDINARY_TURN_COORDINATOR=0` restores the previous flatten-every-turn path. Pending callback Promises are not serialized; the lineage stores only tool ids, names, and policy digests. After owner death, an exact credential/model/tool-catalog/tool-id batch resumes the persisted Agent and sends a synthetic host-recovery turn with `local.force=true`. Concurrent duplicate-same recovery is singleflight. Assistant replay bodies are not persisted, so duplicate-same after a later process restart still has no persisted response body.

When no exact live or persisted owner can attach, tool continuation may cold-branch only from a self-contained transcript. The latest assistant tool batch must exactly match the submitted result ids and every call must exist in the request catalog. Historical completed calls are indexed by stable tool-name/input signature; if the recovered Harness requests one again, the gateway returns the recorded result internally rather than exposing the same side effect to the client twice. Identical recovery requests are singleflight and replayable for the normal replay TTL.

Before any semantic response is emitted, a generic SDK authentication-session failure is checked with an official `Cursor.me` credential probe. A still-valid key receives one same-credential Agent rebuild; an invalid key fails immediately. Managed mode may then try one different compatible account for authentication, permission, rate-limit, timeout, or upstream failures. No retry occurs after response headers/deltas begin.

## Injection

Production uses `createCursorRuntime({ stateDir })` and passes the matching credential-partitioned `JsonlLocalAgentStore` and workspace to every `Agent.create` and `Agent.resume`. Tests inject `FakeSdk`. The HTTP layer never imports `@cursor/sdk` directly except through that adapter.

Gateway lineage is a separate JSON file store under `STATE_DIR/lineage`. It recovers completed Agent ids and exact pending-tool metadata; pending callback Promises themselves are never serialized.
